# api-service Package Documentation

## Overview
The `api-service` package is designed to handle the core functionalities of the API service. It includes various modules and components that work together to provide a robust and scalable API service.

## Structure
The package is organized into several key modules:

1. **Controllers**: This module contains the controller classes that handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate service methods.
2. **Services**: This module includes the service classes that contain the business logic of the application. These services interact with the data layer and perform necessary operations.
3. **Models**: This module defines the data models used throughout the application. These models represent the structure of the data and are used for data validation and manipulation.
4. **Repositories**: This module contains the repository classes that handle data access and persistence. These classes interact with the database and provide methods for CRUD operations.
5. **Utilities**: This module includes utility classes and functions that provide common functionalities used across the application, such as logging, error handling, and configuration management.

## Key Components

### Controllers
- **APIController**: Handles the main API endpoints and routes requests to the appropriate service methods.
- **AuthController**: Manages authentication and authorization endpoints.

### Services
- **UserService**: Contains business logic related to user management, such as creating, updating, and deleting users.
- **AuthService**: Handles authentication and authorization logic, including token generation and validation.

### DTO
- **User**: Represents the user entity with attributes like `id`, `name`, `email`, and `password`.
- **Token**: Represents the authentication token with attributes like `token` and `expiry`.

### Repositories
- **UserRepository**: Provides methods for interacting with the user data in the database, such as `findById`, `findAll`, `save`, and `delete`.
- **TokenRepository**: Manages token data, including methods for `findByToken` and `save`.

### Utilities
- **Logger**: Provides logging functionalities to log messages and errors.
- **ErrorHandler**: Handles application-wide error handling and exception management.
- **Config**: Manages configuration settings and environment variables.

## Usage
To use the `api-service` package, instantiate the necessary controllers and services, and set up the routing for the API endpoints. Ensure that the database connection and configuration settings are properly initialized.
